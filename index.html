            currently studying at National University with the aim becoming  a skiled programer, which is why i chose the BSCS-ML course. 10 years ago my dream was to become a talented architecture and a professional basketball player. Back in elementary school, I was passionate about drawing and participated in schools contest because i admired my  grandfather. How ever I also played basketball after class and dreamed of playing in prestigious leagues such as the NCAA, UAAP and PBA.
